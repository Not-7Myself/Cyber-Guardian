        <h1>What is Malware?</h1>
    Ransomware: In this type of cybercrime, cybercriminals install malware on
    the victim's computer system, encrypting their files and potentially causing
    system damage.<br> They then demand a ransom from the victim and, upon
    receiving the payment, delete the malware from the system.<br><br>
    Virus: A computer virus is a special type of malware that enters a system,
    replicates, and infects other computer programs, causing significant damage<br>
    to the entire system. It can corrupt and delete numerous files through selfgenerated code, even affecting the core of the computer system.<br><br>
    Trojan : A Trojan program pretends to be a legitimate one, but it is in fact
    malicious. A Trojan can’t spread by itself like a virus or worm, but instead
    must be executed by its victim, often through social engineering tactics<br>
    such as phishing. Trojans rely on social engineering to spread, which puts
    the burden of defense on users<br><br>
    Spyware : Cybercriminals use spyware to monitor the activities of users.
    Spyware often leads to credential theft, which in turn can lead to a
    devastating data breach. It often originates in corrupt files, or through
    downloading suspicious files.<br>
    Keyloggers are a common kind of spyware that monitors and records users’
    keystrokes. With this kind of spyware, hackers can steal credentials as well
    as credit card numbers and other data that may be entered into a system
    through typing.
