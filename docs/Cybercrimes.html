        <h1>What are CyberCrimes?</h1>
    Cybercrime encompasses a wide range of criminal activities that are carried out using digital devices and/or networks. 
    crimes involve the use of technology to commit fraud, identity theft, data breaches, computer viruses, scams, and expanded upon in other malicious acts
    <br><br>
    <h4>Reasons of Cybercrime</h4>
    Profit: The majority of cybercrimes are motivated by the pursuit of
    financial gain. Cybercriminals exploit the threat of cybercrimes, as
    previously mentioned, by targeting victims and demanding
    significant sums of money.<br>
    Personal Grudges: Cybercriminals may harbor personal
    grievances against their victims. To seek revenge or mentally
    harass individuals, they commit cybercrimes and derive
    satisfaction from their success.<br>
    Hatred for Organizations: Cybercriminals may hold a grudge
    against prominent organizations such as YouTube, Facebook, or
    central and state governments. In an attempt to exact revenge,
    cybercriminals hack into their servers and attempt to disrupt their
    operations.
    <br><br>
    <h4>HOW DO THEY DO IT?</h4>
    Phishing Attacks: In Phishing Attacks, cybercriminals send anonymous links to users'
    computer systems. These links are designed to blend seamlessly with the surrounding
    content, increasing the likelihood of the user clicking on them. Cybercriminals
    sometimes provide false and enticing information to encourage users to click on the
    link. Once the user clicks on the link, cybercriminals seize the opportunity to take over
    the victim's computer system.<br>
    Malware: Such links may contain malware, computer viruses, or ransomware that can
    cause damage to computer systems.<br>
    Technical Support: Cybercriminals may deceive users by claiming that their computer
    systems have been infected by a computer virus and offer technical support to
    remove it, prompting users to click on the provided link.
    Update Messages: Cybercriminals may deceive users by providing false information
    that their devices require an update, leading them to click on the link to update their
    computer systems.<br>
    Wi-Fi Network: Weak passwords, outdated firmware, and missed software updates in
    a user's router settings make their network vulnerable. By hacking into the Wi-Fi,
    cybercriminals can gain access to all devices connected to that router
    <br><br>
    <h4>Consequences</h4>
    Financial Loss: As discussed earlier, cybercrimes are
    primarily aimed at extracting money from victims,
    resulting in significant financial losses.<br>
    Business Disruption: Businesses can face disruption in
    various ways, including financial loss, hacking of
    servers leading to malfunctions, and attacks on
    reputation and brand value through server breaches.<br>
    Lost Reputation: Victims of cyberbullying who have
    their social media accounts hacked face a high risk to
    their reputation.
